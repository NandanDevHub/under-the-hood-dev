# 🔍 Under the Hood

> A personal deep-dive into the internals of programming, software design, and systems — focused on understanding the *why* and *how*, not just the *what*.

## 🧠 Purpose

This repository is my journey to master software fundamentals from scratch, exploring what's really happening "under the hood" of code, languages, frameworks, and systems.

Whether it's:
- How the CLR works in .NET
- What makes memory management safe
- Why certain patterns are used in ASP.NET Core
- How SQL indexing actually improves performance

...this repo answers those with clarity.
