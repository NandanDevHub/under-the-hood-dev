# C# Programming – Foundational Level 3

## Classes, Objects, Fields, and Methods (Deep Clarity & Examples)


### 36. What is a class in C# and why do we need it?

**Explanation:**  
A **class** is a blueprint or template used to create objects. It defines the **structure** (what data it holds) and **behavior** (what actions it can perform) for similar types of entities.

**Why use it?**
- To group related data and actions together
- To reuse the same structure for multiple objects
- To model real-world entities in software

**Real-world analogy:**  
A **blueprint of a car** is like a class. It defines what a car should have (engine, wheels, color). You don’t drive the blueprint — you use it to make real cars (objects).

**C# Example:**
```csharp
class Car
{
    public string Color;
    public void Drive()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Car is driving...");
    }
}
```

### 37. What is an object and how is it related to a class?

**Explanation:**  
An **object** is a real instance created from a class. It has actual values and can perform the actions defined in the class.

**Why needed?**
Classes are just designs. Objects are real usable entities you can interact with.

**C# Example:**
```csharp
Car myCar = new Car();       // Create an object
myCar.Color = "Red";         // Set property
myCar.Drive();               // Call method
```

**Analogy:**  
If the class is the car blueprint, an object is the actual red car parked in your garage.

### 38. Why use objects in programming?

**Explanation:**  
Objects help organize and manage complex data in real-world applications. Instead of using separate variables for `CarColor`, `CarSpeed`, `CarOwner`, etc., you can bundle them inside an object.

**Benefits:**
- Better code organization
- Easier to scale and maintain
- Promotes real-world thinking

### 39. What are fields and properties in a class?

**Explanation:**
- A **field** is a variable defined inside a class to store data.
- A **property** is a special way to **control access** to fields.

**Why use properties instead of public fields?**
To validate or secure access to data — you might want to allow "read-only" or custom logic when setting a value.

**C# Example:**
```csharp
class Person
{
    private string name;  // Field

    public string Name    // Property
    {
        get { return name; }
        set { name = value; }
    }
}
```

**Analogy:**  
Think of a bank account. You can’t take money directly from the vault (field), you use ATM rules (property) that validate and control access.

### 40. What is a method in a class and how is it used?

**Explanation:**  
A **method** is a block of code (function) inside a class that defines what the object can do.

**Why use methods?**
They represent actions. Instead of writing code repeatedly, define it once inside a method and call it when needed.

**C# Example:**
```csharp
class Calculator
{
    public int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

**Usage:**
```csharp
Calculator calc = new Calculator();
int result = calc.Add(5, 3);  // result = 8
```

**Analogy:**  
In real life, a coffee machine (object) has a “brew” button (method). Pressing it performs the action defined inside.
